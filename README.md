# Flutter Supabase Integration

This repository provides a Flutter project template with integrated Supabase as the database backend. With this template, you can quickly start building Flutter apps that leverage Supabase for data storage and management. Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, offering real-time data synchronization, authentication, and more.

## Features

- Flutter project structure set up with Supabase integration.
- User authentication using Supabase Auth.
- CRUD operations with a Supabase database.
- Real-time data synchronization with Supabase.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-supabase-integration.git
```

### Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd flutter-supabase-integration
```

### Install the required dependencies.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

1. Create a Supabase project and obtain the API URL and API Key. You can do this by signing up at Supabase.
2. Update the Supabase configuration in the lib/utils/supabase_client.dart file with your API URL and API Key.

```dart
const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_API_URL';
const supabaseKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY';
```

### Run the Flutter app.

```bash
flutter run
```
Open the app on your emulator or device to start using the Flutter app with Supabase as the database backend.
